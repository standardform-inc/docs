You should receive an email from Standard Form to get access.

## What to expect

- **Invitation email** — We'll send you a link to sign up or accept an invitation to your organization.
- Use the link in the email to log in for the first time or to accept your invite.
- After you accept, you'll land in your dashboard or the start flow if your organization doesn't have a schedule yet.

## Where to go first

- If you're creating your first schedule: follow the flow **Fill basic information → Define time boundaries → Add your team → Add blocks → Define coverage → Write rules**, then generate. See [Creating Block Schedules](/creating-block-schedules/time) for details.
- If you're joining an existing team: use the dashboard to view and manage schedules, physicians, and settings.
