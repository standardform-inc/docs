Standard Form is scheduling software for residency and physician programs. You define your schedule (block-based rotations or shift/call), add your team, blocks, coverage needs, and rules — and the system generates the assignments for you.

## Who it's for

- **Chief residents** — Build and manage schedules.
- **Administrators** — Set up the organization, invite the team, and manage settings.
- **Program directors** — Oversight and understanding how schedules work.

## Key concepts (in plain language)

| Term | What it means |
|------|----------------|
| **Schedule** | The overall plan (e.g. academic year) with a start and end date. |
| **Block** | A rotation or activity you're scheduling (e.g. Wards, Clinic, Nights, Leave). |
| **People** | Physicians or residents on the schedule, with rank (e.g. PGY1–4). |
| **Coverage** | How many people must be on a block at any time. |
| **Mandate** | How many times each person must do a block (e.g. "each resident does Wards at least 2 times"). |
| **Rules** | Plain-language constraints (e.g. "no more than 3 nights in a row", "spread weekends fairly"). |
| **Leave** | Time off; people can submit leave preferences and the system avoids assigning them then. |

Block schedules assign people to full rotations (e.g. "Week 1–4: Wards"). Shift or call schedules assign people to specific shifts (e.g. "Monday 7a–7p"). You can create both; see [Creating Block Schedules](/creating-block-schedules/time) and [Create Shift Schedules](/create-shift-schedules/call-schedules).
