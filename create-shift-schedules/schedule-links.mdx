A schedule can be linked to a **parent** schedule. For example: a yearly block schedule is the parent, and a call schedule is the child. The child's availability (when people can be on call) can follow the parent's block assignments.

## Why use it

- **Parent** = block schedule (who is on which rotation when).
- **Child** = call schedule (who is on call which days).

The call schedule then only assigns people when they're available according to the parent block schedule.

## Where to set it

Set the parent schedule when creating or editing the child schedule (e.g. in schedule settings or the create flow). Versioning and [regenerating](/managing-block-schedules/regenerate) work as usual; changes to the parent can affect the child.
