**Shift (call) schedules** are different from block schedules. In a block schedule, people are assigned to full rotations (e.g. "Week 1–4: Wards"). In a call schedule, assignments are **shifts** — specific start and end times on specific days (e.g. "Monday 7a–7p").

## When to use call schedules

Use call schedules for call rotas, shift-based coverage, and similar needs where you're assigning people to time slots within days rather than to multi-week blocks.

## Key ideas

- **Shifts** — Time slots (day of week, start/end). You can define standard vs extended shifts.
- **Coverage and rules** still apply, but in a shift context.

You can create a call schedule from the same "Create schedule" or start flow — choose the **Shift** or **Call** schedule type. If your call schedule should respect who is on which rotation when, see [Schedule links](/create-shift-schedules/schedule-links).
