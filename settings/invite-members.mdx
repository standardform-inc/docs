Account owners (and others with permission) can invite team members to the organization. Invitees get an email with a link to accept and join.

## How to invite

1. Go to **Dashboard** → **Settings** → **Team** (or **Invite**).
2. Enter the person's email and choose their role if your plan has roles (e.g. owner vs member).
3. They receive an email; they click the link, sign up or log in, and accept the invite.
4. After accepting, they see the organization in their dashboard.

If someone didn't receive the invite, see [Getting started](/welcome/getting-started) and [Contact us](/contact-us/contact).
