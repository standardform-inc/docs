Rules are written in plain language. Examples: "no more than 3 nights in a row," "spread weekends fairly," "rest between heavy blocks." The system turns them into constraints when generating the schedule.

## Where to add rules

Use the **Rules** step when creating or editing a schedule, or the rules/constraints section in your dashboard.

## Best practices

- **Be specific** — Add examples so the system understands what you want.
- **Avoid vague or overly broad rules** — They can lead to the schedule failing to generate or unexpected results.

If the schedule cannot be generated, rules (alone or with coverage and mandate) might be conflicting or too strict. See [Failure to generate](/creating-block-schedules/failure-to-generate).
