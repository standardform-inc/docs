Sometimes the system can't find a schedule that satisfies everything you've set. You'll see a message like: **"Schedule cannot be generated. The constraints you've defined are impossible to satisfy with the current inputs."**

## What to review

1. **People vs coverage and mandate** — Make sure you have enough people to meet every block's [coverage](/creating-block-schedules/minimum-coverage) and [mandate](/creating-block-schedules/mandate).
2. **Mandate** — Only use mandate when there's a real requirement. Don't add it just for balance; it can make the problem impossible.
3. **Rules** — Be as specific as possible and add examples. Clear [rules](/creating-block-schedules/rules) help the system find a solution.

## What you can try

- Reduce coverage or mandate where it's reasonable.
- Simplify or relax rules.
- Add more people if that's an option.
- Reduce leave if appropriate.
