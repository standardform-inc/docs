For each block (and optionally by day of week), you define how many people must be assigned — for example "2 residents on Wards at any time."

## Where to set it

Use the **Coverage** step in the start flow or the coverage section in your dashboard. Coverage is linked to your [blocks](/creating-block-schedules/blocks).

## Coverage vs mandate

- **Coverage** = how many people are needed on a block at once.
- **Mandate** = how many times each person must do that block (e.g. "each resident does Wards at least 2 times").

Both must be achievable with your roster. If coverage numbers are too high for the number of people you have, the schedule may fail to generate. See [Failure to generate](/creating-block-schedules/failure-to-generate).
