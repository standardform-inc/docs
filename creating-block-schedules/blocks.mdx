Blocks are the rotations or activities you're scheduling — for example Wards, Clinic, Nights, ICU, or Leave.

## What to set for each block

- **Name (label)** and optional description.
- **Load type** and **allowed roles** — which ranks can be assigned to this block.
- **Leave block** — Mark a block as leave so the system can assign leave time; this ties in with [leave preferences](/creating-block-schedules/leave).
- **On-call** — Mark if the block is for call.

## Where to add blocks

- The **Blocks** step when creating or editing a schedule, or  
- Inside the schedule in your dashboard.

The order and list of blocks matter: coverage and mandate are defined per block. Use clear, unique names so your team can understand the schedule.

Next: [Define coverage](/creating-block-schedules/minimum-coverage) and [Mandate](/creating-block-schedules/mandate).
