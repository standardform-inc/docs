A **mandate** is the minimum number of times each person (by role) must be assigned to a block — for example "each resident must do Wards at least 2 times."

## Where to set it

Set mandate per block in the schedule (e.g. by role and count).

## When to use it

Only when there's a real requirement (e.g. program requirements). Don't add mandates just to "balance" the schedule — overuse can make the problem impossible and lead to [failure to generate](/creating-block-schedules/failure-to-generate).

**Difference from coverage:** Coverage = "X people on this block at once." Mandate = "each person does this block at least N times."
