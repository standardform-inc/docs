Define when your schedule runs and how time is divided into slots.

## What to set

- **Schedule start and end date** — The date range for this schedule (e.g. July 1 to June 30).
- **Slot size** — How one "slot" is defined: by day, week, two weeks, or month. This affects how blocks are placed.
- **Statutory leave days** — How many leave days per person the system accounts for (for fairness).

## Where to set it

Use the **Time** step when you start a new schedule, or edit the schedule in your dashboard.

<Tip>
**Tip:** The end date must be after the start date. Slot size affects how blocks are assigned — choose what matches how your program works.
