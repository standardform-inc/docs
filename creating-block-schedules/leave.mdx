Residents submit when they need time off (vacation, conference, personal leave). The system uses those dates so it doesn't assign them during leave.

## How it works

1. You send a **leave preferences** link (e.g. by email) to your team.
2. They open the link, choose their leave dates or ranges, and submit.
3. Those dates are stored and used when you generate or regenerate the schedule.

## Your role

- Trigger or send the leave preference invitations (or share the link yourself).
- Collect leave before generating or regenerating so the solver can respect it.

If too many people have leave at the same time, the schedule might not be possible to generate. See [Failure to generate](/creating-block-schedules/failure-to-generate) and [People](/creating-block-schedules/people).
