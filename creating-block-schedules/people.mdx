Add everyone who will be on the schedule. The number of people and their roles determine whether the system can meet your coverage and mandates.

## What you need

- **First name, last name, email** — Required for each person.
- **Rank** — e.g. PGY1, PGY2, PGY3, PGY4. Roles are used for coverage and mandates.

## Where to add people

- **Dashboard** → Physicians, or  
- The **People** step when you're creating or editing a schedule.

Each person has one account (one email). You can add, edit, or remove people; if someone needs to submit leave, they'll use the [leave form](/creating-block-schedules/leave). If the schedule can't be generated, check that you have enough people for your [coverage](/creating-block-schedules/minimum-coverage) and [mandates](/creating-block-schedules/mandate) — see [Failure to generate](/creating-block-schedules/failure-to-generate).
