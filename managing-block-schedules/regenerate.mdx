Each time you generate or regenerate a schedule, the system creates a new **version** — a snapshot of the assignments. What you see is the latest version.

## When to regenerate

Regenerate after you:

- Change [people](/creating-block-schedules/people), [blocks](/creating-block-schedules/blocks), [coverage](/creating-block-schedules/minimum-coverage), [mandate](/creating-block-schedules/mandate), or [rules](/creating-block-schedules/rules).
- Collect new [leave](/creating-block-schedules/leave) and want it reflected.
- Want a fresh solution.

## How to regenerate

Use **Regenerate** (or **Refresh**) in the schedule view. You'll get a confirmation: regenerating replaces the current solution with a new one, and any draft changes to the schedule will be lost.

If the new result can't be generated, you'll see the usual message; see [Schedule won't generate](/creating-block-schedules/failure-to-generate) for what to check.
