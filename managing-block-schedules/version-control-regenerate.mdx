Each time you generate or regenerate a schedule, the system creates a new **version** — a snapshot of the assignments. The view you see is the latest version.

## When to regenerate

- After changing [people](/creating-block-schedules/people), [blocks](/creating-block-schedules/blocks), [coverage](/creating-block-schedules/minimum-coverage), [mandate](/creating-block-schedules/mandate), [rules](/creating-block-schedules/rules), or [leave](/creating-block-schedules/leave).
- When you want a fresh solution (e.g. after collecting new leave preferences).

## How to regenerate

Use **Regenerate** or **Refresh** in the schedule view. You'll see a confirmation: *"This will regenerate the schedule based on current inputs. Any draft changes to the schedule will be lost."* Confirm to run the solver again.

## Version controlling

- The current view is the **latest version**. Regenerating **replaces** the current solution with a new one.
- Any unsaved or draft edits to the schedule grid will be lost when you regenerate — the new result becomes the new current version.

## If regeneration fails

If the new result is **infeasible**, the app will show the infeasible dialog. See [Failure to Generate](/creating-block-schedules/failure-to-generate) for what to review and how to fix it.
